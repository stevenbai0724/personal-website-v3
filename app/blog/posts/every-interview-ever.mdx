title: 'Every Interview Ever in Chronological Order'
publishedAt: '2025-03-31'
summary: 'Literally every single interview I've done.'
---

This might literally be EVERY single one I've done, trying my very best to remember what they asked, how I performed, and the result.

Keywords to look out for in terms of UWaterloo's coop system:
    - **wworks** = Waterloo's coop board
    - **external** = other, either through app portal, cold email, etc
    - **Rank 1** = employee ranks you highest and gives offer
    - **Ranked** = employee ranks you but not first
    - **Not Ranked** = gg

        **Hackerrank OA**
        - I applied on the Simplify Github page like 4-5 months prior. This was my first quant company process! They sent a Hackerrank which for some reason was the easiest OA of my life, 4 easy's and 1 medium in 70 minutes. I finished and passed all cases in under 30.

        **30 minutes recruiter call**
        - The recruiter asked basic questions about my current/previous software engineering experiences, some behavioural questions about teamwork and workplace situations. They also asked about things I do outside of work that show my passion for programming + finance, I gave a pretty shitty answer about how I do a bit of competitive programming here and there, and how I invest in crypto (that's a lie). I passed the vibe check!

        **1 hour technical**
        - They asked conceptual questions about like C++ vs Javascript, linked list vs arrays, etc and how are they similar/different + pros/cons etc. I did pretty poorly at explaining it to be honest! They also asked this [brain teaser/math question](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/15ww2m3/pick_two_opposite_corners_of_a_cube_with_side/) which I was able to explain and walkthrough in around 5 minutes, I had never seen it before. Then they asked [Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/description/) which is pretty trivial but I choked a bit coding it up in Java (C++ was not available). Overall I felt really awful about this interview, questions weren't hard at all but I didn't answer well and just had slip ups here and there, probably costed me the time of having a second coding exercise which some candidates would make it to. They rejected me as expected. Was a little sad since they could've flown me out to New York for onsites if I passed.

    <Dropdown title="Squint (S25 wworks)">
        [Squint Inc](https://www.squint.ai/)

        (I regret not trying harder to prepare for this one. I got this one on the Waterloo coop portal right after I already signed with Wealthsimple, and the job posting said it was a remote job which was really displeasing to me. So I originally planned on no-showing the interview but then the day before, they sent out an email saying that they're changing the logistics of the job and it would be onsite at the San Francisco office which made it actually worth trying for. I had less than a day to prepare and I regret not caring about it enough because I was burnt out from recruiting)

        **30 minutes system design interview**
        - They sent me a Miro board and then gave minimal instructions to design an elevator system supporting 2-3 elevator shafts. They outlined the 3 major components, the request panels on each floor, the central server and the elevator clients. I wish I had sounded more confident and gave a more structured step by step approach to the whole system design style interview but this was like my second time doing it (the first time I completely folded). I think I didn't do too bad, I described how I would have the elevators situated in default positions, optimize to pickup/drop off passengers without having to switch directions halfway, emergency system, etc. I think my biggest flaw was that I lacked structure and confidence, because I think I did a poor job at presenting some very valuable findings and edge cases. Better luck next time!

        **30 minutes leetcode**
        - The next part was a Leetcode hard, [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/description/). I prioritized getting a working solution before any optimizations so I coded it up in like 15 minutes and then discussed how to use memoization and other optimizations given smaller constraints (if each cell can only have numbers 1-9: optimize by skipping search on cells that can't result in a better path than the current max length). The Leetcoding finally came into use and I think this round was pretty flawless, although I only got ranked for this job probably because of my system design interview and my number of work terms completed (only 2.5 up to this point). I definitely gained a lot more confidence for future system design / Leetcode interviews after this one. Didn't match with the job but that's lowkey good because I might've had to go through the trouble of reneging on Wealthsimple which would be very sad.

    <Dropdown title="Wealthsimple (S25 external)">
        [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com)

        **Round 1: 45 minutes pair programming**
            - Received a week or two after getting a referral. Straightforward OOP problem in Javascript with 3 parts, first part took 5 minutes, second part was long and took around 30 minutes and the third part was a challenging, small DSA extension + discussion to test algorithmic thinking and problem solving. I think most people don't make it to the third part and I answered well, so I passed.

        **Round 2: 30 minutes project demo**
            - A quick 20 mins presentation of a technical project with 10 mins for questions about enhancements, questions about decisions made and difficulties, etc. They were looking for communication and storytelling skills so I made [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mfGL0s9oR2-wx9DCHBLPXPoPLZWkk1mSbgGeLV9ewpM/edit#slide=id.p). I presented my work at Algomonster and they seemed to love it!

        **Team match: 30 minutes**
            - Luckily only had to meet with one manager, who asked many questions about my resume, current ongoing work projects and goals for next term. Asked about concepts like scalability, databases, request latencies, etc. Got the job offer after this call!

    <Dropdown title="Shopify (S25 external)">
        [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)
        
        **Screening**
            - The assessments were very long. IQ/EQ tests + a coderpad which was supposed to be really easy for a Leetcoder, but was capped at 25 mins and was so confusing for some reason. I finished with only 3 mins to spare.

        **Round 1: 45 minutes pair programming**
            - Received after 2 weeks. Interview was a really fun mix of system design and OOP, I got a simpler version of design bitly (URL shortener). Basically I had to implement the function which maps URL's to shortened keys and vice versa, and then discuss system design concepts. I was also tested on whether or not I knew how to open a pull request on GitHub. Passed!

        **Round 2: 30 minutes behavioural**
            - I fumbled this one even though it was really simple. They do kind of like a "Life Story" interview where they ask questions about your career, interests and goals, and also some behavioural questions about workplace difficulties etc. I think I was a bit nervous and just wasn't performing at my best during the interview, got rejected. This one hurt quite a bit because everyone and their mother on my LinkedIn feed is working there for S25, I regretted being a bit too overconfident while prepping for this round.

        I signed an NDA for this one so I can't even say what I got. I think I'm allowed to say I got not ranked though, the interview was a bit confusing and I didn't communicate well.

    <Dropdown title="Super (S25 wworks)">
        [Super](https://www.super.com)
        
        **Screening**
            - I received an OA which I believe was not automatic, and it consisted of 2 Leetcode easy questions and a simple API call exercise in Python. Only a few languages like Python, JS, Java and Go were allowed and this was for a full stack/product role. I think for these OA's you need to pass all test cases.

        **Interview: 1 hour technical**
            - The interview was an implementation exercise, with 4 parts that build on top of each other. Basically just parse a huge JSON object and it got progressively more complicated. I did it in Javascript and I finished all parts with time to spare. Interviewer gave some positive feedback but also pointed out that my code wasn't very clean sometimes and hard to follow. They GHOSTED me after this, and didn't even bother to let me know on rankings day in the WaterlooWorks portal. It literally takes less than 10 seconds to send a rejection email, what is wrong with you recruiters.

        [Whatnot](https://www.whatnot.com/)
        
        **Recruiter Call**
            - I actually cold emailed a recruiter back in Oct 2023 and they said my grad date was too late. I was dedicated enough to remember and send them another email exactly a year later in Oct 2024 and they kicked off the process! The recruiter call was some basic resume questions and behavioural questions and I got the green light.

        **Round 1: Leetcode Interview**
            - The interview didn't test any algorithms. There were 2 questions and the first one was really easy although I wasted time debugging for like 5 minutes. The second question was very long, I basically had to parse entries from 3 different tables and do a bunch of calculations and refactoring. I chose C++ which was like the worst possible language for this task. I had like 30 ```vector<vector<string>>```'s and ```map<string, int>```'s and got so lost I didn't finish in time and got rejected. SHOULD'VE CHOSE PYTHON.

        **45 minute interview: resume discussion + system design**
            - I came into the interview already thinking I wouldn't get it, since I had a feeling their small team size is looking for someone who is extremely skilled especially in AI and game dev. The founder was very intimidating, and grilled me about my experiences and projects. I couldn't understand a lot of the design concepts he was asking about. We moved onto system design which was to discuss how to design Figma. I pretty much just folded and the guy was like basically spoonfeeding me and teaching me basic concepts like Websocket connections which I somehow didn't already know at the time. As expected I got not ranked.

        [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com)
        
        **Interview: 45 minutes behavioural + small technical**
            - The interview was mostly behavioural questions about collaboration, leadership, situations where I received constructive feedback and adapted, etc. I thought I stumbled a bit on these and the interviewer (my current manager actually) seemed very dead serious the whole time. In the last 10 minutes I got a question about how I would verify if a math equation with coefficients and letter variables in the form of a string is equal or not on both sides (basically use a hash map). I got rank 1 a few days later and took the offer!

    <Dropdown title="Birdseye Post (W25 wworks)">
        [Birdseye Global Inc.](https://birdseyepost.com)
        
        **Round 1: 30 minutes in person interview**
            - I was really excited to get this in-person interview at the Tatum Center in Waterloo. I met with a Cofounder and an Engineer and talked about my experiences, mostly about my previous internship, why I want to work for this startup, and the technologies I'm familiar with. I think they said only half of the 8 candidates would move onto the final stage, and I passed.

        **Round 2: CEO call**
            - I had a really quick 30 minute call with the CEO and he was asking me about why I'd be a good fit, and other behavioural questions. He also asked about hobbies and I told him about my Pokemon collection and we had a really fun talk over it. I thought it went really well but I only got ranked. I took Constant Contact instead since this was during the same recruiting cycle.

    <Dropdown title="TikTok (S25 external)">
        [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com)
        
        **Screening**
            - I got a Hackerrank which had 5 MCQ's, very easy fill in the blank to complete the code questions. The OA also had 2 Leetcode mediums, which required knowledge in binary search, basic modular arithmetic and prefix sums. I think the allowed time was like 70 minutes but I finished in 30.

        **Round 1: 45 minutes for 2 Leetcode Mediums**
            - The first question was [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/) and I finished in reasonable time. I forgot the second one but it was a simulation question and the full solution required math which I didn't fully get. They still passed me though!
        
        **Round 2: Leetcode Hard**
            - This round began with some experience questions, leaving only 30 minutes to solve [Design In-Memory File System](https://algo.monster/liteproblems/588). I almost finished but it was just way too much coding and I wasn't fast enough to code up a Trie in C++ for a hard question. They GHOSTED ME after this round which I was really mad about. After this round the recruiter literally said they'd get back in 2-3 weeks and I was so restless every single day waiting for the result, only to get ghosted and rejected 3 months later. I hate TikTok. GO FUCK YOURSELF.

    <Dropdown title="Dots (W25 external)">
        [Dots YC S21](https://dots.dev/) 

        **Round 1: 30 minutes screening**
            - I got into the process by sending a cold email to an intern at the time who was recruiting. I made a strong, very brief email about my contributions at Algomonster and got invited to meet with a Cofounder. He asked me questions about my resume, my interest in Dots and some basic logistics. The Cofounder & CEO, Sahil, was one of the friendliest and most outgoing people I've ever met in tech.
        
        **Round 2: 1 hour full stack live coding**
            - I had to implement a fully functioning frontend and backend which supported image upload and saving files to disk. I chose to use React and Express but I was very unprepared for this task, as building from scratch was not something I did on a daily basis. After setting up React and Express and getting an image to upload I got absolutely shafted when trying to figure out how to successfully send the image data from the react app to the proxy server. I pretty much gave up. Luckily Sahil was really nice and we walked through it together, with both of us knowing that I had completed failed. At least he didn't roast me!

        [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com) 

        **30 Minute Screening**
            - I LITERALLY FAILED. The questions weren't tough or anything but I was just so anxious for some reason, and also definitely didn't prepare well enough. They asked about what I knew about Autodesk and why I was interested and I was just stumbling all over the place and didn't come up with good answers on the spot. I seriously doubted my skills after this one.

        [Algomonster](https://algo.monster)

        **1 hour Call w/Cofounder**
            - I was referred by my good friend [kevinyang](https://leetcode.com/u/_kevinyang/) to this position at a small bootstrapped company. The Cofounder asked me about my experiences briefly and was interested in my DSA skills and experience with NextJS. Luckily I had a solid Leetcode profile and a lot of dev experience with React so he was impressed and kind of moved forward? This process was overall very informal.

        **Amongus tasks**
            - They wanted an intern to build and scale an [interview guide page](https://algo.monster/interview-guides) and wanted me to put together something like [this](https://stevenbai0724.notion.site/Airbnb-Hiring-Process-9d94803545534a9ea547f2a2bfd03a5e?pvs=4) to experiment with it. They also made me resolve some GitHub issues to see if I was not dumb. It went well and we proceeded with the offer! Ended up being a really important and useful internship.

        [Kolena](https://www.kolena.com/)

        **1 hour interview**
            - The position was for frontend development in React. They only interviewed 3 candidates on WaterlooWorks and I was one of them. The interview was mostly resume grilling and some behavioural questions. The interviewer said he cared a lot about the candidates' portfolios and work term reports which was very interesting, I don't think many recruiters look that deep. There was a really easy technical question which was as follows: given a list of objects, return a list of those same objects but without duplicates. I got ranked and they emailed me saying I was ranked number 2, and the rank 1 person took the job. I was in shambles.

        **30 minute interview**
            - Got selected for a React Native + Firebase role, interview began with basic questions about my interest in the company and past experiences. Went pretty well, and then the last 10 minutes were a quick test to see how much React I knew. It was an implementation exercise (didn't have to compile and render though) to test state management and callbacks. It was easy and I communicated well, and even moved onto the bonus which was just testing if I knew how to write up a `useEffect()` to fetch from an API. I felt like a React wizard and I don't think I would've changed a thing about my responses, and yet I still got only ranked (and didn't match). Shit happens.

        [Rich Media](https://www.richmedia.com/)

        **30 minute interview**
            - This was for a junior web developer role. In the beginning of the interview they asked me to rank a bunch of technologies on a scale of 1-5 based on my own proficiency and made me explain the work I did with the ones that were of high rating. They also asked some behavioural questions and about my knowledge of the company itself, and I think I answered well. This was my second WaterlooWorks interview and I was still rusty and didn't really know what I was doing, but I remembered to smile a lot. They ended up giving me rank 1 and I'm super grateful to have landed a job during a difficult hiring period for first year students.

        [Jana Corporation](https://www.janacorporation.com/)

        **45 minute interview**
            - This was technically my first ever real interview, for a Junior Frontend Developer position. At the start of the interview there were 2 interviewers asking me about what kind of coding projects I did in high school and how I got started with programming so I talked about [this project](https://github.com/stevenbai0724/dmojstats). I thought I sounded so slick talking about deploying on Heroku and learning to use Express + React, all before the GPT days. They seemed impressed and then a third guy came into the meeting and started the "technical" part. He proceeded to ask me coding trivia FOR 30 MINUTES STRAIGHT. It started off easy, I remember being asked the classical `const` vs `let` vs `var` question, and then some of them got more frontend specific like `display: hidden` vs `display: none` in CSS, and then questions about the React Virtual DOM. Then I had to explain `git rebase` vs `git merge`, which I still don't really know to this day. I think I answered like 25% of the trivia, and I ended up getting ghosted even after multiple check in emails. 0/10 first interview experience.
